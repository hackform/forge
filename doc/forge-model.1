.SH NAME
.PP
forge\-model \- Generates models


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBforge model [query ...] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generates common SQL patterns needed for relational models

.PP
forge model is called with the following environment variables:

.PP
.RS

.nf
GOPACKAGE: name of the go package
GOFILE: name of the go source file

.fi
.RE

.PP
forge model code generates go functions for SQL select, insert, update, and
delete for a model by default, with additional queries provided as arguments.

.PP
The SQL table's columns for a model are specified by the "model" tag on fields
of a Go struct representing a row of the table. A "model" tag's value has the
following syntax:

.PP
.RS

.nf
column\_name,sql\_type

.fi
.RE

.PP
Fields without a "model" tag are ignored.

.PP
One field must contain a sql\_type with "PRIMARY KEY".

.PP
A query allows additional common case select statements to be code generated.
It is specified by a "query" tag on a struct representing a row of the query
result with a value of the syntax:

.PP
.RS

.nf
column\_name[,flag[,args ...][; ...]]

.fi
.RE

.PP
column\_name refers to the column name defined in the model. The go field type
must also be the same between the model and the query.

.PP
Fields without a "query" tag are ignored.

.PP
Valid flags are:
    \- get: (no args), gets a single row where the field value is equal to the
        input
    \- getgroup: (no args), gets all rows ordered by the field value
    \- getgroupeq: args(equal\_field,...), gets all rows where the equal field(s)
        value(s) is equal to the input ordered by the field value
    \- getgroupset: (no args), gets all rows where the field value is in the input
        set ordered by the field value
    \- updgroupeq: args(equal\_field,...), updates all rows where the equal
        fields(s) values(s) is equal to the input
    \- updgroupset: (no args), updates all rows where the field value is in the
        input set
    \- delgroupeq: args(equal\_field,...), deletes all rows where the equal
        fields(s) values(s) is equal to the input
    \- delgroupset: (no args), deletes all rows where the field value is in the
        input set
