## forge model

Generates models

### Synopsis

Generates common SQL patterns needed for relational models

forge model is called with the following environment variables:

	GOPACKAGE: name of the go package
	GOFILE: name of the go source file

forge model code generates go functions for SQL select, insert, update, and
delete for a model by default, with additional queries provided as arguments.

The SQL table's columns for a model are specified by the "model" tag on fields
of a Go struct representing a row of the table. A "model" tag's value has the
following syntax:

	column_name,sql_type

Fields without a "model" tag are ignored.

One field must contain a sql_type with "PRIMARY KEY".

A query allows additional common case select statements to be code generated.
It is specified by a "query" tag on a struct representing a row of the query
result with a value of the syntax:

	column_name[,flag[,args ...][; ...]]

column_name refers to the column name defined in the model. The go field type
must also be the same between the model and the query.

Fields without a "query" tag are ignored.

Valid flags are:
	- get: (no args), gets a single row where the field value is equal to the
		input
	- getgroup: (no args), gets all rows ordered by the field value
	- getgroupeq: args(equal_field,...), gets all rows where the equal field(s)
		value(s) is equal to the input ordered by the field value
	- getgroupset: (no args), gets all rows where the field value is in the input
		set ordered by the field value
	- updgroupeq: args(equal_field,...), updates all rows where the equal
		fields(s) values(s) is equal to the input
	- updgroupset: (no args), updates all rows where the field value is in the
		input set
	- delgroupeq: args(equal_field,...), deletes all rows where the equal
		fields(s) values(s) is equal to the input
	- delgroupset: (no args), deletes all rows where the field value is in the
		input set
